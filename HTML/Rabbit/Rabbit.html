      <h3> Rabbits come in different breeds and sizes. </h3> 
      <p> <font color ="green" size="3"> Rabbits make great pets. In general rabbits need appropriate housing, exercise, socialisation and a specific diet for good welfare. Some breeds of rabbits, particularly the longer haired rabbits, may require daily grooming.

        <font face ="Arial black" color="lightgreen" size="3"> Rabbits are social and curious animals, who can make fantastic pets. But contrary to popular belief, they are not an 'easy' first pet for a child. Rabbits, like all animals, have specific needs when it comes to their housing, handling, food, and providing enough interesting and stimulating activities for them to do.</font>
